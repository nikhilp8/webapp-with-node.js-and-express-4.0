This project is a walkthrough to build a webapp with node.js and express 4.0. The major things to be implemented in this are
1. node and npm
2. setting up gulp
3. templating engines
4. routing
5. databases

Different tools will be used, which I'll describe more descriptively in the above mentioned pattern.

So, what is Node.js ?

Uses JS language.
It is an open source, server side, runtime environment (wrapper around JS language).
Cross platform (Can run JS code in windows,linux,OSX)

What is express ?

It is a web development framework for Node.js.
It's light weight, unopinionated & minimalistic. It handles routing, page rendering.
Ultimately it's an NPM package.
We'll write code using express objects.

Now, Install node.js from nodejs.org
